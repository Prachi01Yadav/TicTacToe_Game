## Features

- Two-player local mode (Player vs Player).
- Clear, well-documented game logic and win/draw detection.
- Minimal dependencies — easy to run locally.
- Structured so it’s simple to add AI, a GUI, or a web frontend.

## How to Play

- Players alternate turns placing their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 board.
- The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If all squares are filled without a winning line, the game is a draw.
